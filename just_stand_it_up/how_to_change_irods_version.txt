You can instruct which repo and branch to build by setting different build arguments.

Example:

    ./build_image.sh my_image --build-arg irods_repo=... --build-arg irods_branch=... <etc.>

Available arguments are:

    irods_repo          = URL to iRODS github repository
    irods_branch        = iRODS branch to build
    icommands_repo      = URL to the iRODS icommands repository
    icommands_branch    = icommands branch to build
    cmake_path          = Full path to the CMake binary (e.g. /opt/irods-externals/cmakeX.X.X/bin)
